This is not related to AI in any sense.
But, this is the first ever proper project I've made.
I have Included this becaause this is in python.

HOW to run:
the main file to run is alien_invasion.py
==> All the other files just have nesscary classes for the games to work
==> It may not work few times on other systems some times because I have used pycharm to make this ,so it may miss some essentials.
==> pls forgive me for any mistakes because it is the first ever time I have created a repository to share my code.
